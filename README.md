### Part 2: Angular Client Application

## Requirements
Pending

## Build and Run the Application
In the Spring Boot service's top-level directory (_service_) execute the following command:
```./mvnw package``` 

After executing the above command, ```cd``` to the _target_ directory and run the following command:
```java -jar target/loan-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```

## Service Endpoints
The following service endpoints are available:
- GET /api/v1/loans/{id}
- PUT /api/v1/loans/{id}
- DELETE /api/v1/loans/{id}
- GET /api/v1/loans
- POST /api/v1/loans
- GET /api/v1/loans/{id}/borrowers

## OpenAPI Documentation
Swagger-based OpenAPI documentation is available for the Spring Boot service, here: ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html```

## Comments and Considerations
- The application's Spring Boot service is implemented with Java 16 and targetting it, as well. If this was an actual production 
service, I would have used a [Java LTS release](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html) instead &mdash; 
currently either Java 11 or, the very recently released, Java 17.
