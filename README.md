### Part 2: Angular Client Application
Pending

## Requirements
Pending

## Build and Run the Application
In the project's top-level directory execute the following command:
```./mvnw package``` 

After executing the above command, ```cd``` to the _target_ directory and run the following command:
```java -jar target/loan-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar```

## Calling Endpoints
Pending

## OpenAPI Documentation
Swagger-based OpenAPI documentation is available for the application, here: ```http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui.html```

## Comments and Considerations
- The application's Spring Boot service is targetting Java 16. If this was an actual production service, I would have used a 
[Java LTS release](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/java-se-support-roadmap.html), currently either Java Release 11 
or &mdash;the very recently released&mdash; Java Release 17.
